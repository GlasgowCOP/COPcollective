The Glasgow COP Collective are a group of concerned citizens from a variety of backgrounds who
recognise the climate and ecological crises as the most significant threat of our time. The ultimate
aim of the collective is to encourage change which mitigates against the worsening threat of the
climate and ecological crises, with a focus on Glasgow. To achieve this, the collective will use the
knowledge and experience of its members to make climate education accessible and relatable for a
broad audience, lobby for policy change on a local and national governmental level, and network
with other like-minded climate conscious groups. The experience within the group is commonly
high-level, with many of the members researching for, or having already been awarded PhDâ€™s within
sciences, arts, and law. The collective has members who have extensive experience in science
communication and social outreach giving the collective the credentials to achieve its goals. The
collective formed as all of its members feels the importance of sending a clear message that the
climate and ecological crises need to be halted. The collective is still in its infancy and the precise
route to achieve its goals is still being determined. The collective is currently running a networking
phase to cooperate and coordinate with other like-minded groups within Glasgow.
